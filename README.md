# 🍽️ Omnifood Meals Service (Portfolio Project)

Omnifood is a **modern landing page** built with **HTML and CSS**, created as part of my web development learning journey.  
This fictional service provides personalized meal delivery every day of the year. Users can set their food preferences, and an AI system generates recipes based on their likes and dislikes. The meals are then delivered directly to the user at the scheduled time.
